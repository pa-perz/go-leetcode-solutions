# My Go LeetCode solutions

This is a repo where I store my Go/Golang leetcode.com solutions.

My intention making this page public is to allow my friends and people who want to know more about Go to check how it works and see the testing I do to check the solutions.

I know this could allow some people to copy my solutions but the solutions are almost always posted on the Discuss page anyway.
